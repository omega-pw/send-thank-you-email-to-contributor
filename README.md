[Deploy this function on flows.network](#deploy-pr-merge-notifier-on-your-github-repo), and you will automate the work to get reach out to the contributors. When the Pull Request is merged by maintainers, send a thank-you email to the contributors automatically. 

> This function works when the contributor has a public email on his/her profile page. If the contributor sets his/her email address private, then we can't send him an email.

## Deploy PR Merge Notifier on your GitHub repo

### 0 Prerequisite 

1. You will need a [Sendgrid API key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). If you do not already have one, [sign up here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).
2. You will also need to sign into [flows.network](https://flows.network/) from your GitHub account. It is free.

### 1 Create from a template

[**Just click here**](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/send-thank-you-email-to-contributor)

Click on the **Create and Build** button.


### 2 Configure the GitHub integration

Next, you will tell the bot which GitHub repo it needs to monitor for upcoming PRs.

* `github_owner`: GitHub org for the repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.
* `github_repo` : GitHub repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.

> Let's see an example. You would like to deploy the bot on `WasmEdge/wasmedge_hyper_demo` repo. Here `github_owner = WasmEdge` and `github_repo = wasmedge_hyper_demo`.

Click on the **Connect** or **+ Add new authentication** button to give the function access to the GitHub repo to deploy the ðŸ¤–. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to the repo.

Close the tab and go back to the flow.network page once you are done. Click on **Deploy**.

### 3 Configure the SendGrid integration

Next, you will need to set up the email. Here we use SendGrid to do this.

* `sendgrid_sender_address`: the sender's email, which should be the same as your SendGrid setting.

Click on the **Connect** or **+ Add new authentication** button to give the function access to use your email address. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to your SendGrid account.

Close the tab and go back to the flow.network page once you are done. Click on **Deploy**.

## Wait for the magic

As soon as the flow function's status turns `ready` and the flow's status becomes `running`, the PR merge notifier goes live. Get connected with your contributor right away as contributors increase!
